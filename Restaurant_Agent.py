This program simulates waiting in line at a restaurant.

Assumptions:
- Each customer orders something from a list of food items
- Each food item will have a predetermined cost and preparation time. 
For example, a hamburger can be cooked between 10 - 12 mins.
- During the operational hours of the restaurant, customers will randomly enter in different intervals of the day.
- Customers will show up more during lunch and dinner hours
- Customer or group size can vary throughout the day
- Group size will increase time in a restaurant eating
- If there are not enough seats to fit a group, then the restaurant has to combine tables to fit the group
- If queue times are too long then the last customer in the queue will leave
- The number of customers that enters the queue is randomized
- Restaurant has a max capacity of people that be queued 
- If restaurant reaches max capacity inside the restaurant, the last person in queue needs to leave 
because there is no more room inside the restaurant
- Customers in a group order the same food
- The average wait time includes waiting in line and waiting for a customerâ€™s food to be served to them
